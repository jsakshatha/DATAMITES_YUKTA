    "-  In most cases, Data Scientists deal with data extracted from massive open data sources such as the internet, surveys, or reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This data is crude and is known as raw data.\n",
    "- It may contain missing values, unstructured data, incorrect inputs, and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we directly use this raw, un-processed data to train our models, we will land up with a model having a very poor efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thus Feature Engineering plays an extremely pivotal role in determining the performance of any machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyzing The Dataset Features iis very important,\n",
    "- Whenever you get your hands on a dataset, you must first spend some time analyzing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This will help you get an understanding of the type of features and data you are dealing with.\n",
    "- Analyzing the dataset will also help you create a mind map of the feature engineering techniques that you will need to process your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now our dataset is feature engineered and all ready to be fed into a Machine Learning model.\n",
    "- This dataset can now be used to train the model to make the desired predictions.\n",
    "- We have effectively engineered all our features.\n",
    "- The missing values have been handled, the categorical variables have been effectively encoded and the features have been scaled to a uniform scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rest assured, now we can safely sit back and wait for our data to generate some amazing results!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have effectively feature engineered all the variables in your dataset, you can be sure to generate models having the best possible efficiency as all the algorithms can now perform to their optimum capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering, like so many things in data science, is an iterative process. Investigating, experimenting, and doubling back to make adjustments are crucial.\n",
    "- The insights you stand to gain into the structure of your data and the potential improvements to model performance are usually well worth the effort.\n",
    "- Plus, if you’re relatively new to all this, feature engineering is a great way to practice working with and manipulating DataFrames! So stay tuned for future posts covering specific examples (with code) of how to do just that.\n",

    "\n",
    "- This is a simple way to check whether you need to investigate certain data points before using more sophisticated methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using visualizations\n",
    "- You can use software to visualize your data with a box plot, or a box-and-whisker plot, so you can see the data distribution at a glance. This type of chart highlights minimum and maximum values (the range), the median, and the interquartile range for your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many computer programs highlight an outlier on a chart with an asterisk, and these will lie outside the bounds of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistical outlier detection\n",
    "- Statistical outlier detection involves applying statistical tests or procedures to identify extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can convert extreme data points into z scores that tell you how many standard deviations away they are from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a value has a high enough or low enough z score, it can be considered an outlier. As a rule of thumb, values with a z score greater than 3 or less than –3 are often determined to be outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the interquartile range\n",
    "- The interquartile range (IQR) tells you the range of the middle half of your dataset. You can use the IQR to create “fences” around your data and then define outliers as any values that fall outside those fences.\n",
    "### Interquartile range method\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sort your data from low to high\n",
    "- Identify the first quartile (Q1), the median, and the third quartile (Q3).\n",
    "- Calculate your IQR = Q3 – Q1\n",
    "- Calculate your upper fence = Q3 + (1.5 * IQR)\n",
    "- Calculate your lower fence = Q1 – (1.5 * IQR)\n",
    "- Use your fences to highlight any outliers, all values that fall outside your fences.\n",
    "- Your outliers are any values greater than your upper fence or less than your lower fence."

    "- Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model.\n",
    "- It is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model.\n",
    "- When creating a machine learning project, it is not always a case that we come across the clean and formatted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The steps used in data preprocessing include the following:\n",
    "- Data profiling\n",
    "- Data profiling is the process of examining, analyzing and reviewing data to collect statistics about its quality.\n",
    "- Data cleansing.\n",
    "- Data reduction.\n",
    "- Data transformation.\n",
    "- Data validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data preprocessing transforms the data into a format that is more easily and effectively processed in data mining, machine learning and other data science tasks.\n",
    "- The techniques are generally used at the earliest stages of the machine learning and AI development pipeline to ensure accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are several different tools and methods used for preprocessing data, including the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sampling, which selects a representative subset from a large population of data;\n",
    "- transformation, which manipulates raw data to produce a single input;\n",
    "- denoising, which removes noise from data;\n",
    "- imputation, which synthesizes statistically relevant data for missing values;\n",
    "- normalization, which organizes data for more efficient access; and\n",
    "- feature extraction, which pulls out a relevant feature subset that is significant in a particular context.\n",
    "- These tools and methods can be used on a variety of data sources, including data stored in files or databases and streaming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is data preprocessing important?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine learning and deep learning algorithms work best when data is presented in a format that highlights the relevant aspects required to solve a problem.\n",
    "- Feature engineering practices that involve data wrangling, data transformation, data reduction, feature selection and feature scaling help restructure raw data into a form suited for particular types of algorithms.\n",
    "- This can significantly reduce the processing power and time required to train a new machine learning or AI algorithm or run an inference against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data preprocessing techniques\n",
    "- There are two main categories of preprocessing -- data cleansing and feature engineering. Each includes a variety of techniques, as detailed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data cleansing\n",
    "- Techniques for cleaning up messy data include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify and sort out missing data.\n",
    "- There are a variety of reasons a data set might be missing individual fields of data.\n",
    "- Data scientists need to decide whether it is better to discard records with missing fields, ignore them or fill them in with a probable value.\n",
    "- For example, in an IoT application that records temperature, adding in a missing average temperature between the previous and subsequent record might be a safe fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduce noisy data. Real-world data is often noisy, which can distort an analytic or AI model.\n",
    "- For example, a temperature sensor that consistently reported a temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit might erroneously report a temperature as 250 degrees.\n",
    "- A variety of statistical approaches can be used to reduce the noise, including binning, regression and clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify and remove duplicates. When two records seem to repeat, an algorithm needs to determine if the same measurement was recorded twice, or the records represent different events.\n",
    "- In some cases, there may be slight differences in a record because one field was recorded incorrectly.\n",
    "- In other cases, records that seem to be duplicates might indeed be different, as in a father and son with the same name who are living in the same house but should be represented as separate individuals.\n",
    "- Techniques for identifying and removing or joining duplicates can help to automatically address these types of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature engineering\n",
    "- Feature engineering, as noted, involves techniques used by data scientists to organize the data in ways that make it more efficient to train data models and run inferences against them.\n",
    "- These techniques include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature scaling or normalization. Often, multiple variables change over different scales, or one will change linearly while another will change exponentially.\n",
    "- For example, salary might be measured in thousands of dollars, while age is represented in double digits.\n",
    "- Scaling helps to transform the data in a way that makes it easier for algorithms to tease apart a meaningful relationship between variables.\n",

    "##### Data reduction.\n",
    "- Data scientists often need to combine a variety of data sources to create a new AI or analytics model.\n",
    "- Some of the variables may not be correlated with a given outcome and can be safely discarded.\n",
    "- Other variables might be relevant, but only in terms of relationship -- such as the ratio of debt to credit in the case of a model predicting the likelihood of a loan repayment; they may be combined into a single variable.\n",
    "- Techniques like principal component analysis play a key role in reducing the number of dimensions in the training data set into a more efficient representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Discretization.\n",
    "- It's often useful to lump raw numbers into discrete intervals.\n",
    "- For example, income might be broken into five ranges that are representative of people who typically apply for a given type of loan.\n",
    "- This can reduce the overhead of training a model or running inferences against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Feature encoding.\n",
    "- Another aspect of feature engineering involves organizing unstructured data into a structured format.\n",
    "- Unstructured data formats can include text, audio and video.\n",
    "- For example, the process of developing natural language processing algorithms typically starts by using data transformation algorithms like Word2vec to translate words into numerical vectors.\n",
    "- This makes it easy to represent to the algorithm that words like \"mail\" and \"parcel\" are similar, while a word like \"house\" is completely different.\n",
    "- Similarly, a facial recognition algorithm might reencode raw pixel data into vectors representing the distances between parts of the face."

    "\n",
    "- The basic concept behind the standardization function is to make data points centred about the mean of all the data points presented in a feature with a unit standard deviation.\n",
    "- This means the mean of the data point will be zero and the standard deviation will be 1.\n",

    "- Here we are working with the mean and the standard deviation.\n",
